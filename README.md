# Lisp_Model

A symbolic meta-cognition module for AGI, implemented in Common Lisp.

## Overview

This module represents a reflective reasoning layer within a modular AGI architecture. It models symbolic conceptual objects and interfaces with a Prolog-based logical reasoning backend to simulate meta-cognitive operations.

### Features

- **Conceptual Object Modeling**  
  Defines symbolic objects with types and arbitrary property maps.

- **Meta-Cognitive Execution Loop**  
  Simulates introspection and symbolic reasoning using a controlled narrative sequence.

- **Prolog Integration Stub**  
  Sends logical queries to a Prolog module (stubbed for now, expandable via external process or socket API).

## Core Functions

- `(create-object name type &rest properties)`  
  Creates a new conceptual object with arbitrary key-value properties.

- `(query-prolog query)`  
  Sends a logic query string and returns a response (currently hardcoded).

- `(brain-main-loop)`  
  Demonstrates object creation and symbolic reasoning using internal state and Prolog interaction.

- `(run-lisp-session)`  
  Entry point for script-based execution. Can be replaced with argument dispatch logic.

## Running

Ensure you have **SBCL** (Steel Bank Common Lisp) installed.

```bash
sbcl --script brain-core.lisp
```
## Planned Extensions

Replace Prolog stub with live integration (swipl or similar).

Add argument-based dispatch to support multiple Lisp modes (e.g., introspection, visualization, transformation).

Allow input/output streams or sockets for communication with the Python orchestrator.
